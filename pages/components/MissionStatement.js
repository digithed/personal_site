              I began my career working in a molecular biology lab. I didn't, and still don't, have a degree in Computer Science. Through a desire to learn I taught myself several programming languages such as
              Python, Javascript, and HTML. I began writing small scripts to help with work. I eventually took a few college CS courses, and finally got a job as a Junior Software Engineer. That was three years ago and I've learned a lot since then.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              I would like to share my experience of career transition, and impart
              my knowledge of software engineering for those coming from alternative backgrounds. As someone who has come from an alternative path I believe I'm a friendly and patient mentor willing to explain
              coding concepts from unique points of view, and not just espouse those of a CS major.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              I am offering courses for learning programming in Python and Javascript/HTML. There are three levels for each course: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. We will ease into learning starting from the chosen level and eventually build our own project together.
              I offer a personalized experience of virtual 1:1 software engineer mentoring and tutoring.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              I believe that with the right motivation, people can find new strengths. Although I cannot promise a software engineering job after working with me, I believe working together will certainitly improve the odds.
